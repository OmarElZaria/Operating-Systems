# Operating-Systems
This respiratory includes the design and implementation of operating systems software. Topics include: Introduction to operating systems concepts, process management, memory management and file systems. The laboratory exercises includes implementing software that helps understand core operating system concepts.

Warmup:
 Implemented a program that uses several file-system related system calls. System calls provide entry points into the operating system, allowing programs to run operating system code. 
 This part of the lab provided me with experience writing programs that use operating system functionality extensively.
 
Threads:
  created a library of functions that define a user-level threads package. Using my library, a program will be able to create threads, destroy them, and run them concurrently on a single processor.
  Implemented preemptive threading, in which simulated "timer interrupts" cause the system to switch from one thread to another.
  Implemented blocking locks for mutual exclusion, and condition variables for synchronization.
  
Webserver:
  Developed a multi-threaded web server, and evaluated its performance.
